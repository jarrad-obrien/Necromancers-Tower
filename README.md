# Necromancers-Tower
My first attempt at making a proper game using Unity. It's a wave defence game where the player controls a mobile ground unit (moved using the keyboard) that autoattacks when an enemy comes into range. The player also uses the cursor to shoot from the tower itself.

I learnt a lot about designing methods, finding and fixing bugs, and how much work it takes to develop something that's even the tiniest bit worthwhile.
