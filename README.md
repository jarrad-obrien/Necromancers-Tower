# Necromancers-Tower
My first attempt at making a proper game using Unity. It took me quite a while to get the game to where it is now. I'm surprised at how long it took me to solve bugs that seemed small. 
I learnt a lot about designing methods, finding and fixing bugs, and how much work it takes to develop something even the tiniest bit worthwhile.
